DVD Menu Animator is a tool to aid in the creation of menus for DVD-Video discs.
You use it in conjunction with DVDAuthor and Inkscape; Inkscape to do the actual
design and layout of the menu graphics, which DVD Menu Animator then turns into
a form that can be input to DVDAuthor, along with the movie footage, to create
the DVD-Video directory structure.

To build and install DVD Menu Animator, execute the following command as root:

    python setup.py install

The user manual can be found, in HTML format, in the docs/ subdirectory.
