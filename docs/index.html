<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</DIV>
<P>DVD Menu Animator is a tool to aid in the design of
<A HREF="http://wlug.org.nz/DVDVideo">DVD-Video</A> menus. It is meant to be used in
conjunction with <A HREF="http://wlug.org.nz/dvdauthor">dvdauthor</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</A>: you use Inkscape to do the main design of the
menu appearance and button placement; choose additional highlight and selection colours
in DVD Menu Animator; then put the results through the <TT>spumux</TT> tool (part of
<TT>dvdauthor</TT>) to generate the menu.</P>

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</DIV>
<P>DVD Menu Animator consists of three parts: the main program, which is a
<A HREF="http://python.org/">Python</A> script, an extension module referenced by that script,
called <TT>spuhelper</TT>, which needs to be compiled, and an “Overscan Margins”
plug-in for Inkscape. To build and install everything, just do this as superuser in the
directory containing the source files:
<BLOCKQUOTE>python setup.py install</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Usage"></A>Usage</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="UsingInkscape"></A>Making a Menu in Inkscape</DIV>
<P>Start by creating a new drawing for your menu in Inkscape. The actual dimensions
and measurement units don’t matter; what <I>does</I> matter is the <I>aspect ratio</I>
(ratio of the width of the drawing to its height): this should be either 4:3 (narrowscreen)
or 16:9 (widescreen). Typically you will want to match the aspect ratio of the video footage
you are going to include on the DVD.</P>
<P>There is no limit on the complexity of the designs you can create, fonts you can use
etc, but bear the following in mind:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Don’t put stuff too close to the edges; allow a margin for overscan (see
<A HREF="#Overscan">below</A> for more).
<LI>You can have no more than 4 different colours.
<LI>If you use transparency effects, then the areas where objects with such effects
overlap will add to the count of different colours.
<LI>Don’t use gradients.
</UL>
<P>Your design must have a minimum of two layers (though it can use more). This is because
DVD Menu Animator expects the topmost layer to contain information about the buttons in
your menu. You can name the layers what you like, but it’s probably a good idea to name
the topmost one something like “Buttons”, to help remind yourself what it’s for.
<P>In the button layer, each button is represented as a rectangle object. (The DVD-Video
spec requires buttons to be rectangles, which is why you can’t use any other shape.)
The fill and stroke settings you assign to buttons don’t matter; I’d recommend an empty
fill, and a thin stroke just sufficient so you can see the locations of the buttons against
your underlying menu graphic, to verify that they are lined up properly, without obscuring
too much of the actual graphic. Whether you set this layer to visible or not when you
save the drawing also doesn’t matter (though of course it <I>does</I> matter for the other
layers making up the menu image.) Use this layer only for defining the buttons, because
anything else you put on it will be ignored.</P>
<P>Oh, and colours you use on the button layer don’t count towards the 4-colour limit.</P>
<P>Besides creating a rectangle for each button, you also have to give each button a unique name.
To do this, click the button rectangle and select “Object Properties...”  from Inkscape’s
Object menu. In the resulting dialog, enter the button name in the id field (the Label
and Title are ignored):
<P STYLE="text-align : center"><IMG SRC="object_properties.png"></P>
<P>You can also define here which neighbouring buttons the user will go to from this one
if they use the arrows on their remote. This information goes in the Description field,
where you can specify any or all of the following, one to a line, in any order:
<UL>
<LI><TT>up=</TT><I>button_name</I>
<LI><TT>down=</TT><I>button_name</I>
<LI><TT>left=</TT><I>button_name</I>
<LI><TT>right=</TT><I>button_name</I>
</UL>
<P>Note these settings are case-sensitive, and spaces are not allowed.
<P><B>Don’t forget to click the “Set” button before closing this dialog</B>.
<P>Once you’ve finished the above steps, save your Inkscape drawing and start up
DVD Menu Animator.

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="Overscan"></A>Allowing for Overscan</DIV>
<P>Unfortunately, it is a “feature” of consumer televisions that they do <B>not</B>
show the entire video image on the screen. Instead, a few percent is
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan">cut off at the edges</A>. Video footage
needs to be shot with this in mind, and so does the design of your menus.
<P>To help you keep your design from encroaching into the unsafe area, use the included
Overscan Margins plugin. In the current (0.4<I>x</I>) versions of Inkscape, you will
find this under the “Extensions” menu, in the “Video” submenu:
<P STYLE="text-align : center"><IMG SRC="overscan_margin.png"></P>
<P>Type in numeric percentages of the horizontal and vertical image dimensions,
and when you click “Apply”, a new layer will be added to the drawing, containing a
grey fill in the margins of appropriate thickness. Simply ensure no important part
of your design overlaps any part of the margins.
<B>Don’t forget to hide or delete this layer before saving your menu.</B>

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="Animating"></A>Animating Your Menu</DIV>
<P>In DVD Menu Animator, select “Load Menu Image...” under the File menu to load the
SVG file you created with Inkscape. If all goes well, you should see it appear on the
left side of the main DVD Menu Animator window:</P>
<P STYLE="text-align : center"><IMG SRC="animator.png"></P>
<P>Next to the image is a set of radio buttons title “Using Colours:”. This lets you
display the menu image in its various states. We will come back to this in a moment.
<P>To the right of these radio buttons are two lists, titled “Buttons” and “Button Layer”.
You can verify that the “Buttons” list contains the names you assigned to your buttons.
This list doesn’t serve any other purpose as the moment. The “Button Layer” list shows
the layers in your drawing, with the topmost (button) layer already preselected. Don’t
click in this list—I should probably get rid of it.
<P>To the right of these is a tall, empty list. You can load a
<A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</A>-format (.gpl) colour palette
with the “Load Colours...” option under the File menu, and then drag colours to from here
to the elements in the other colour lists.
<P>Now we come to the three important colour lists, titled “Normal”, “Highlight” and
“Select”. The first one contains the colours that will be used for all the buttons
in their normal state; the second one will be used for the button that the user has
currently highlighted with their remote; and the third one will be used to briefly
display the highlighted button when the user hits the OK/Enter button. All three lists
are initially populated with the original colours from your drawing, but you are free
to change them.
<P>You’ll note that the first list usually contains more than 4 colours. The additional
ones are the result of <I>anti-aliasing</I> by the SVG renderer to make the graphics look
smoother. Unfortunately, the DVD-Video spec doesn’t allow for such anti-aliasing, so
DVD Menu Animator has to undo its effects, by mapping those extra colours onto the
closest-available ones of the most popular 4 in the image (the first 4 entries in the list).
Before doing so, it does a check that the image “predominantly” consists of just 4 colours
(where “predominantly” means “at least 95% of the pixels”). If it does not, then you will
see a message like this at the bottom of the main window:
<BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN STYLE="color : #FF0000">852 colours is too many, mustn't exceed 4</SPAN>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and you will have to go back to Inkscape to simplify your menu graphic.
<P>You can double-click the colours in these lists to bring up a chooser dialog that
lets you change them; or you can drag and drop between entries in different lists, and
also from the loaded-palette list at the right, as mentioned previously.
<P>And now we come to those “Using Colours:” radio buttons I mentioned earlier. These
let you display the menu graphic in the following states:
<UL>
<LI>Original—as you originally drew the image in Inkscape, complete with anti-aliasing
applied.
<LI>Normal—remapped down to the first 4 colours in the “Normal” list. If you haven’t
changed those colours, then the main difference between this and the previous option
is that this one has more prominent “jaggies” because there is no anti-aliasing.
<LI>Highlighted—remapped to the colours in the “Highlight” list.
<LI>Selected—remapped to the colours in the “Select” list.
<LI>Live—allows you to actually click buttons in the menu to observe how it will
behave in the final DVD-Video title. You can click within the area of a button within
the menu image, and you can use the arrow keys to test out the navigation. And you
can press Enter (or double-click) to briefly display the highlighted button in its
“selected” colours.
</UL>

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="Transparency"></A>Transparency and Backgrounds</DIV>
<P>DVD-Video allows colours in a menu to be partially or totally transparent. You can
control this with the Opacity slider in the colour chooser that appears when you double-click
a colour. For example, you might start out with a white background for your menu in Inkscape,
but in DVD Video Animator you can turn this background transparent, so the actual video
image for the menu shows through.
<P>You can simulate the effect of a background video image in DVD Video Animator by
selecting “Load Background Image...” from the File menu. This lets you load a JPEG image
file that will show through transparent parts of the menu image. Of course a single still
image is not the same as a fully-animated video, but it should still help give you some idea of
how the final menu will look.

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="Saving"></A>Saving Your Menu</DIV>
<P>Once you’ve done all the tweaking you want to do, you can save your work by
selecting “Save Menu...” from DVD Menu Animator’s File menu. This lets you choose a name
for the XML file that it generates for you to input to spumux. This name is also used
to automatically construct related names for the associated PNG images representing
the actual menu image in its three states, which will be referenced from the XML file and
generated at the same time.</P>
<P>And here you also choose what video format (NTSC or PAL) your DVD-Video disc will be
using, so it knows what pixel dimensions the final menu images should have (720x480 for NTSC,
720x576 for PAL).</P>

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Frequently-Asked Questions</DIV>
<P><B>Q: Text is displaying as solid black rectangles.</B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>This is because Inkscape is using a tag that has not been accepted into current
official SVG specifications to represent flowed text blocks. Go back to Inkscape, click on
each problem text block in the drawing, and select “Convert to Text” from Inkscape’s Text menu.
Save your changes, and re-open the drawing in DVD Menu Animator to see how it looks now.

<P><B>Q: All my video is in NTSC format Is there a way I can have it default to NTSC,
instead of asking me all the time?</B></P>
<P><B>Q: All my video is in PAL format Is there a way I can have it default to PAL,
instead of asking me all the time?</B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>Yes. Create a directory called <TT>.config</TT> in your home directory
(it probably already exists). Within that directory, use your favourite text editor
to create a file called <TT>video_format</TT>. That file should contain a single line,
consisting of the word
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>NTSC</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>PAL</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When you next launch DVD Menu Animator, it will default to your chosen format.
<P>More generally, DVD Menu Animator supports all the different ways of specifying this
setting defined in the
<A HREF="http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/Video_Format_Pref">Video Format Preference</A>
proposal.

<P><B>Q: After saving a menu, I needed to go back to Inkscape to make some more changes.
Is there a way to avoid re-specifying all the highlight and selection colours again?</B></P>

<P><B>A: </B>Yes! After loading the updated SVG drawing into DVD Menu Animator, select
“Reload Saved Colours...” from the File menu, and choose the menu XML file that you previously
saved. DVD Menu Animator will use this to find the associated
PNG files, and reload their colour tables into the appropriate lists.
